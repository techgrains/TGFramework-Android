# TGFramework-Android
Purpose of TGFramework is to provide developer friendly library, that can help to improve feature development rather focusing on common structure creation during every mobile app development. 

## How to use library?
- Copy [TGFramework.jar](Archives/Library-Jar/TGFramework.jar) into your project's lib folder and start using it !!!
- For documentation of library classes, please refer [Java Doc](Archives/Java-Doc).

## Areas where TGFramework may help

### TGObject
Base class for TGFramework library, having basic supportive methods.

##### How to use:
Make sure to have current class inheriting any of the TG Class. (TGObject, TGActivity, TGService based on which layer you are in.) -OR- Use TGUtil instance directly without changing your existing framework.

Avoid redudant null checks
```
Instead of : if(name!=null && name.size()>0) {...}
Just use   : if(hasValue(name)){...}
```
Easy to become null safe
```
Instead of : text.setText(name!=null ? name : "");
Just use   : text.setText(nullSafeString(name));
```

### TGSession
Single Session instance in memory to hold values in memory as Key-Value pair.

##### Where to use:
- Whenever data is common accross multiple activities.
- Managing data in local storage option (like in local database, shared preference or in disk), when actually data become invalid after app close.

##### How to use:
No need to inherit or initialize anything. 

* Between activities: 
Just straight put things in one activity and use it in another one.
```
Activity 1  : TGSession.instance().put("Designation","Developer");
Activity 2  : String designation = TGSession.instance().get("Designation");
```
Thinking to manage piled up objects in session?
```
TGSession.instance().remove("Designation");
```
* Between service and activity layer: 
Just put in service and have it in Activity. (Easy to put any object.)
```
Service  : TGSession.instance().put("Person",Person);
Activity : Person person = TGSession.instance().get("Person");
``` 

* Common UI rendering place:
Create all the UI pages by binding TGSession attribtues with it. And behind the scene use your own way of using various data sources or services to fill data synchronously or asynchronously in TGSession.

##### TGSessionListener:
Just make any class as Session listener by implementing TGSessionListener. And get the ability to perfrom any post action when any key has been put in session, removed from session or even session become invalidated.

##### Where NOT to use TGSession:
TGSession holds data in app memory (RAM) so whenever it required data to be stored beyond user's app usage. Please consider to store it in local database or shared preference. One can reload in TGSession again when app starts again.

### Upcoming...
- TGModel : Application data models which can bridge service output to UI elements.
- TGService : Common gateway to call outer services
- TGRequest : Http Service Request creation
- TGResponse : Http Service Response creation
- TGError : Error handling

### Anything to say?
Any suggestions or recommendations are most welcome.
